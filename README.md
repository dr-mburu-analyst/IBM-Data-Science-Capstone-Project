The purpose of this capstone project was to predict whether Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. Insights gained are significant in improving prediction 
accuracy, and informing strategic planning for SpaceX launches.

Some of the steps utilized include:

- Spearheaded a capstone project focused on predicting successful Falcon 9 first-stage landings, improving prediction 
accuracy, and informing strategic planning for SpaceX launches.
- Collected data through web scraping from SpaceX's API, prepared it using Python, and advanced data wrangling 
techniques identifying key success factors.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations, creating compelling 
visualizations to communicate key findings effectively.
- Utilized SQL for comprehensive analysis and created interactive maps with Folium to enhance stakeholders'
understanding of the impact of launch sites.
- Implemented predictive analysis techniques, determining Decision Tree (DT), as the optimal model for highest 
prediction accuracy.
